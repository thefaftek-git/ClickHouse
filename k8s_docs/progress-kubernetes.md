# Progress: ClickHouse with Azure Blob Storage in Kubernetes (Azurite)

## Completed Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- ✅ Successfully created Kubernetes cluster using KIND on remote host (192.168.1.246)
- ✅ Verified kubectl, kind, and docker tools are available
- ✅ Created test pod for connectivity testing

### 2. Azurite Deployment (Azure Blob Storage Emulator)
- ✅ Created Kubernetes manifests: `azurite-deployment.yaml`, `azurite-service.yaml`
- ✅ Successfully deployed Azurite pod to Kubernetes cluster
- ✅ Verified Azurite is running and accessible within the cluster

### 3. ClickHouse Basic Deployment
- ✅ Created basic ClickHouse deployment manifest (`clickhouse-deployment-simple.yaml`)
- ✅ Fixed volume mount configuration for ClickHouse container
- ✅ Successfully deployed ClickHouse with default configuration (no custom config)
- ✅ Verified ClickHouse is running and accessible locally within the pod

### 4. Network Configuration Fixes
- ✅ Identified network access issue: `neither CLICKHOUSE_USER nor CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD is set, disabling network access for user 'default'`
- ✅ Fixed by setting environment variables:
  ```yaml
  env:
  - name: CLICKHOUSE_USER
    value: "default"
  - name: CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD
    value: ""
  ```
- ✅ Identified listening interface issue: ClickHouse only listening on localhost interfaces (`::1`, `127.0.0.1`)
- ✅ Fixed by setting environment variable:
  ```yaml
  env:
  - name: CLICKHOUSE_LISTEN_HOST
    value: "0.0.0.0"
  ```

### 5. Connectivity Testing
- ✅ Verified connectivity between pods using direct IP addresses (10.244.0.13)
- ✅ Confirmed ClickHouse service is accessible via ClusterIP (10.96.145.185)
- ✅ Identified DNS resolution issue in Kubernetes cluster (service name resolution not working)

### 6. Configuration Management
- ✅ Created ConfigMap with comprehensive ClickHouse configuration files:
  - `config.xml`
  - `users.xml`
  - `metadata_type_local.xml`
- ✅ Fixed volume mount to use entire `/etc/clickhouse-server/` directory from ConfigMap

## Pending Steps

### 1. Azure Blob Storage Integration Testing
- ❓ Test ClickHouse table creation with Azure Blob Storage backend in Kubernetes environment
- ❓ Verify connectivity between ClickHouse and Azurite for actual data storage operations

### 2. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Document all Kubernetes manifests and configurations
- ✅ Update documentation to reflect Kubernetes/Azurite approach instead of Docker Compose
- ✅ Add troubleshooting tips for common issues (Kubernetes pod errors, Azurite connection problems, ClickHouse configuration errors)

## Known Issues

1. **DNS Resolution**: Service name resolution not working in KIND cluster (`clickhouse-env.default.svc.cluster.local` fails but direct IP works)
2. **ClickHouse Configuration**: Some configurations causing pods to crash (need to isolate and fix specific issues)

## Files Created

- `azurite-deployment.yaml`
- `azurite-service.yaml`
- `clickhouse-configmap-simple.yaml`
- `clickhouse-deployment-simple.yaml`
- `clickhouse-deployment-env.yaml` (with environment variables)
- `clickhouse-deployment-env-all-interfaces.yaml` (with listening on all interfaces)
- `clickhouse-service.yaml`
- `test-pod.yaml`
- `test-pod-clickhouse.yaml`

## Next Steps

1. Test Azure Blob Storage integration with ClickHouse
2. Document complete setup process including all Kubernetes manifests and configurations
3. Update documentation to reflect Kubernetes/Azurite approach
